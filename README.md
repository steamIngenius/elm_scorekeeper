# A Basketball Scorekeeping App in Elm

Run live [here](https://steamingenius.github.io/elm_scorekeeper/)

To develop/run: `$ gulp`

By default the app should be available on `localhost:4000` and the gulp config includes a watcher so that the app is recompiled every time a file is touched.

(You must still reload the app in the browser though)

Take a look at `basketball_scorekeeper.org` or maybe `PLAN.md` to see planning/progress
